# best-friends-club
A gathering place for the best of friends

## TODO
Give human readable names to the games. Auto-generate a fun name from a word bank as default and allow users to create their own game name through a modal.

## Roadmap
1. Add codename tests
2. Add server-side HMR (working but too many hot update files in build)
3. Implement Code Splitting
4. Switch to SSR
5. Add meta information
6. Get coding!

## Development
```
npm install
npm run init
npm run start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080
